 totalism_noun:0 "Totalist"
 totalism_subtype:0 "Totalism"
 totalism_subtype_desc:0 "Totalism is a socially opportunistic (though generally conservative but secular), politically authoritarian, and economically far-left school of thought first chartered at the Birmingham Congress in 1936. The original platform put forward at the inauguratorial conference was mainly a list of policy provisions agreed upon by the §tMaximalist Union§ (Britain), §tProdhoun Circle§ (France), the §tAssociation of Revolutionary Fascists§ (Italy), §WFuturist-leaning§ and §t\"Ultra-Leninist\"§ §RBolsheviks§, and a vast array of fringe radical leftist groups from the world over. Totalists believe that a vanguardist and party-dominated state is the only force that has the power and discipline necessary to rapidly mobilize the nation towards economic prosperity, sovereignty, and modernism. Totalists also tend to be highly nationalistic, especially in the oriental world, though pan-ethnic and even cosmopolitan totalists do exist."
 syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_noun:0 "Syndicalist"
 syndicalism_subtype:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a school of thought that is socially progressive, politically dependable on national circumstance, and economically far left (though having a diverse range of thought in terms of state control of the economy). Syndicalism has had a very long and storied history; beginning among radical trade unionists impatient with the compromising socialist parties of the second internationale, syndicalism would gain dominance in Europe following the Great War and the complete collapse of parliamentary democracies within Britain, France, and Italy; and would famously march to victory in the Second American Civil War. Originally bound to a single document, syndicalism has branched wildly throughout the world in terms of organizational structure and economic policy; though a few common threadlines can be laid. The common charicteristic among syndicalist governments is the institution of the \"Trade Union Congress,\" or the seizure of state power by trade unions. The amount of power that it actually has is often highly dependent on the circumstances of the nation, though everything from nearly pure anarchism to highly centralized bureaucratic structures has been attempted. Syndicalist governments are also nigh-universally socially progressive, cosmopolitan, and at the very least secular towards religion. Syndicalism views itself as the pureest and most direct form of socialism with direct worker democracy as its core value."
 radical_socialism:0 "Radical Socialism"
 radical_socialism_noun:0 "Radical Socialist"
 radical_socialism_subtype:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all term for socially progressive, politically liberal, and economically far-left groups that, for one reason or another, though economically and socially revolutionary in word and character, are opposed to syndicalism. Whether this be due to the radical socialist movement having a religous character, being an agrarian movement, or simply unwilling to abolish parliamentary democracy, radical socialists represent the furthest left a nation can go without abolishing parliamentary democracy. Radical Socialists are often willing to engage in extreme measures of economic interventionism, egalitarian policy, and poverty alleviation, with some even pushing the abolishment of private property, though most believe in its existence."
 social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_noun:0 "Social Democrat"
 social_democracy_subtype:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is a school of thought that is socially progressive, politically liberal, and economically left/center-left/centrist. Social Democracy represents the remnants of the second internationale in Europe and progressivism in North America. Currently represented by the Socialist-Progressive Internationale, socially democratic movements emphasize (at their most radical) a gradual reform towards socialism, with those among its right abandoning socialism all-together. Social Democrats generally believe in stabilization over revolution, focusing on pragmatic policy in parliamentarian democracy to benefit the working and lower classes. Critical to Social Democracy is the idea of balancing positive and negative rights, with the social democrats viewing syndicalism and liberalism as veering too far into either extreme."
 social_liberalism:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_liberalism_noun:0 "Socially Liberal"
 social_liberalism_subtype:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a socially liberal/progressive, politically liberal, and economically center-lef/centrist school of thought. Similar to Social Democracy, Social Liberalism places great emphasis on balancing positive and negative rights, and is still thuroughly on the left in practically all non-Syndicalist nations. Social Liberalism however differs in Social Democracy in its fierce commitment to private property and fiscal health. Social Liberalism is thuroughly rooted within the market structure and as such, though reformist, is far less willing to implement serious reform measures than its counterparts. At the same time, however, it is still on the left, and by no means is a friend to the right."
 market_liberalism:0 "Market Liberalism"
 market_liberalism_noun:0 "Market Liberal"
 market_liberalism_subtype:0 "Market Liberalism"
 market_liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "Market Liberalism (also known as conservative liberalism) is a school of thought that is socially liberal/centrist, politically liberal, and economically center-right/right. Unlike social liberalism, it focuses primarily on negative rights and strongly believes in limiting the government as much as is reasonable acheivable. The goal of a market liberal state is to act as a neutral arbiter among individuals and corporations, and as such tends to focus moreso on public-private partnerships rather than regulation. Market Liberals tend to be opposed to any sort of interventionism in the economy (with the exception that it directly benefit the people, ie the market) though historically it has proven itself to show a progressive streak with regards to opposing tyrannical government and \"cabalistic\" monopolies. To the right market liberals are often strong conservatives in terms of opposing detrimental change, and often finds itself allied with the old guard in revolutionary circumstances, though their relatively libertine social policy makes them bitter frenemies among with the right."
 social_conservatism:0 "Socially Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_noun:0 "Social Conservative"
 social_conservatism_subtype:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "Social Conservatism is a socially center-right, politically liberal, and economically center/center-right school of thought that emphasizes moderation, tradition, and, as the name implies, conservatism. Conservatives are often bitterly opposed to any sort of social change (whether progressive or reactionary) or any economic change that threatens to uppend the community. (Though in limited circumstances Conservatives will support \"reasonable\" demands by their constituents; such as funding for local food banks or farm subsidies.) Though on the right, conservatives are often uneasy about working with reactionaries or radical nationalists; though in times of great upheaval they will usually give their support to them over the left."
 controlled_democracy:0 "Controlled Democracy"
 controlled_democracy_noun:0 "Authoritarian"
 controlled_democracy_subtype:0 "Controlled Democracy"
 controlled_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "Controlled Democracy is a generally socially center-right to right-wing, politically authoritarian, and economically variable though moderate catch-all term for nations that, though they might have a legislative body, legal opposition groups, and a division of powers, are really under the domination of a single clique or party. Controlled Democracies can occur in times of great crisis for a parliamentary democracy, the result of a non-socialist revolution, or as the beginnings of liberalization among a right-wing autocratic regime. The common denominator among all of these situations is that opposition groups are unable to have a realistic path to power and the policy of the leader or ruling clique is that of the nation. As such there is a great deal of variance among controlled democracies with some being border-line revolutionary states while others are extremely conservative."
 paternal_autocrat:0 "Paternal Autocracy"
 paternal_autocrat_noun:9 "Paternal Autocrat"
 paternal_autocrat_subtype:0 "Paternal Autocracy"
 paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is a catch-all term for socially right/far-right, politically authoritarian, and economically center-right/right governments that are oftened centered around one person or a very small group of people. Unlike controlled democracies opposition groups are often completely banned and the entire bureaucracy is controlled by the governing clique. Liberalism is harshly opposed and all are encouraged to give for the nation with little if any room given towards dissent or controversial ideas. Unlike controlled democracy which tends to work any and all moderate reformists autocracy tends to rule alone, though occasionally alliances with revolutionary nationalist groups might be made to stabilize the regime."
 national_populism:0 "National Populism"
 national_populism_noun:0 "National Populist"
 national_populism_subtype:0 "National Populism"
 national_populism_subtype_desc:0 "National Populism is a socially far-right, politically authoritarian, and economically highly variable ideology that represents the mass politics of the extreme right. It is often ethnonationalist and highly religous, with a narrow definition of both accepted peoples and faiths often being implemented, though slightly more tolerant variants do exist. In terms of economics and foreign policy sovereignty is the highest goal above all else, with foreign investments often being banned and confiscated. Entrepenurialship and class collaboration are often common factors in economic policy, though vast state monopolies and even socialized industry tend to be common as well. National Populists are often at the extreme fringe of most societies, even relatively right-wing ones, though in some areas (most notably Russia) they have been able to acheive dominace. Democracy is next to none, though some national populist movement employ heavily populist party-states or even decentralized legislatures."
 USA_totalism_party:0 "§RBanned§"
 USA_totalism_party_long:0 "§gThe American Totalist movement developed during the chaotic final days of the United States and the tumultuous 1936 Presidential election. Never unified, proponents included groups like the§  §RAfrican Blood Brotherhood§ §g,§  §WTechnocracy Inc.§ §g,§  §gand the§  §tWorkers' Fascist Association§ §g.§ \n§gThe African Blood Brotherhood was founded in 1920 as a self-defence society in the Southern United States under the direction of journalist Cyrill Briggs. Originally a black nationlaist, Briggs would later closely align with the Socialist Party during the 1920s and serve as one of its main leaders among the black community. As politics in the South began to exponentially polarize with the explosion of the Ku Klux Klan in popularity among white Southerners, the Socialist Party (Shared with the \"Share our Wealth Party\") in return saw an explosion among southern blacks as the Republican party largely ceased to function in the South. Attracted by the well-funded and organizationally superior ABB, many black nationlists turned their backs on right-wing ethnonationlist movements like the UNIA and soon the ABB and several aligned groups became the face of black civic society south of the Mason-Dixon line. In 1938 as the Constitutional American Republic's offensives in Indiana and Illinois had largely failed the Klan-dominated government nominally led by Eugene Talmadge began to introduce conscription, severe taxation, and forced labor laws among African-Americans. This soon triggered an uprising that would come to known as the Black Belt Revolution. Atlanta was occupied by African forces merely a month after the revolution and the CAR would cease to function as an organized entity shortly after; confined to a bitter guerilla operation in eastern Tennessee and most of the rural South. The ABB would, somewhat controversially, decide to offically join the Combined Syndicates of America during the war and afterwardss become a Socialist State within the newly founded United Socialist States of America. The ABB would voluntarily dissolve itself into the \"Union Congress of Southern Labor\" and form a Syndicalist government shortly after hostilities were concluded. However, many within the former ABB never gave up their ethno-nationlist sentiments; and a successor organization would be created shortly afterwards. Much more in line with the UNIA then the old ABB, the new ABB would be a constant thorn in the side of reconciliation efforts by the UCSL, with members frequently enforcing segregation within their neighborhoods and areas of local control and provoking white communities by spreading black-supremacist literature in many local newspapers. In 1946 the society would be offically banned and stricter press controls would be introduced, but the group remains, if fringe, still active within the Socialist Republic of the Black Belt.\nTechnocracy Inc. was founded as the Technical Alliance in 1919 by Howard Scott, a civil engineer and student of Thorstein Veblen. Technocracy had been gaining in prominance throughout the decade as industry increasingly became fascinated with efficency and scientific principles, with its general principles rapidly becoming accepted within most engineering departments. The movement would however remain mostly academic until the wall street crash of 1925. In the aftermath of the affair and with many blaming the economic ruling class for the disaster, Howard Scott would put forward a revolutionary idea that would replace currency with energy and would completely remake labor relations so they acted in a purely \"scientific\" manner. Though never gaining popularity among trade unions or the industrial elite, Technocracy would find growing acceptance within many universities with well-renowned universities like Columbia even endorsing Scott's plans several times. When hostilities would break out Scott would find common ground with the CSA who were desperate for revolutionary means by which to out-produce their rivals in the war. Scott would find himself as regional director of several factories and construction projects with excellent returns; and his society of technocrats were a badly needed skilled labor pool in a severely braindrained industrial army. After the war Scott would continue to fiercely advocate for his ideals, however, he would find himself outside of the walls of power; though a representative to the Union Congress representing the Society of American Engineers. In 1945 with Chairman Foster seeking to end the \"rivledged position"\ of skilled labor would order all professional unions abolished and merged into their respective general industry unions. Technocracy would react with a general strike of professional workers joined by Maximist/Fascist ideologue James Burnham. The strike would result in both being arrested and Technocracy and Burnham's Society of American Fascism being banned. Though no where near organized as in their heyday and severely lacking in leadership, the Technocrats remain a popular ideological strain among the intelligensia with several university towns being represented by closeted technocrats.§"
